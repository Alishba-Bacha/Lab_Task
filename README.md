Semi Supervised Classification using AutoEncoders
Introduction
By definition, machine learning can be defined as a complex process of learning the best possible and most relevant patterns, relationships, or associations from a dataset which can be used to predict the outcomes on unseen data. Broadly, their exists three different machine learning processes:

1. Supervised Learning is a process of training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset ie. a dataset in which the target variable is known. In this technique, the model aims to find the relationships among the independent and dependent variable. Examples of supervised learning are classification, regression and forecasting. 

2. Unsupervised Learning is a process of training a machine learning model on a dataset in which target variable is not known. In this technique, the model aims to find the most relevant patterns in the data or the segments of data. Examples of unsupervised learning are clustering, segmentations, dimensionality reduction etc.
